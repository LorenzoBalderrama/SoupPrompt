A modern TypeScript SDK for building, testing, and managing prompts for large language models (LLMs). Designed for developers who want to treat prompts as reusable, composable components with full support for testing, versioning, and linting.

- ðŸ§ª Built-in Prompt Testing Suite (`PromptTester`)
- ðŸ§¹ Prompt Linting (`PromptLinter`)
